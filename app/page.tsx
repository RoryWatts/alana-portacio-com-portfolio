          I specialise in early intervention and paediatricsâ€”with a particular focus on hearing loss, neurodiversity, trauma/mental health, and motor speech conditions. I am passionate about delivering family-centred, strengths-based, and neuro-affirming interventions that empower caregivers, educators, and children. I am also dedicated to mentoring and educating early-career Speech Pathologists.
